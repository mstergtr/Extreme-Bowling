# Extreme-Bowling
This is a project designed for teaching children game design and coding. I have used this in the past to demonstrate various concepts including a physics based controller, level design with pro builder, gravity change, playing random audio clips, etc. Efforts have been made to make the code relatively simple while following general clean code principles.
